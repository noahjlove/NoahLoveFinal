			<h3>According to the Gun Violence Archive, there was a 72.15% increase in fatalities from 2013 to 2020 in mass shootings.</h3>
			<p> Gun violence is a problem that has affected many people and communities in the United States. Using guns to commit violent crimes has led to deaths and the shattering of families and communities. Although there is a debate over why shootings occur, there is no doubt that there needs to be discussions about measures to address the issue of firearms. The topic of gun violence is one that needs to be talked about and addressed to bring these tragedies to an end.</p> 

			<p>In 2013, there were 298 fatalities from the mass shootings, and in 2020 there were 513 deaths. There can be many reasons for this, with CNN stating “The increase in mass shootings coincided with an overall rise in gun violence during the pandemic. The US firearm homicide rate in 2020 was the highest ever recorded since 1994, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Between 2019 and 2020, the overall firearm homicide rate increased about 35%, according to the CDC’s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report.” <a href= https://www.cnn.com/2023/01/24/us/mass-shootings-fast-facts/index.html title="_blank">Link to CNN article.</a> There are no police reports on the data set, so some of the information is possibly inaccurate, or not up to date with when it was obtained.</p>

			<h3>The Gun Violence Archive is one of the nation’s top researching organizations about shootings.</h3>

			<p>The Executive Director and Founder, Mark Bryant, gives the ways that his team research shootings so people can be better informed about this subject. “What we do is scraping, and what that really is, is finding articles and police reports…We have 20 people that do the research…when we first started in 2013, we had four people, and we broke the country into 4 areas and one person would pick all the media and law enforcement sites and plow through all of those every day…we moved to automated resources to get stuff done quicker…we learned a lot of lessons from 2013.” A limitation of this data is that it does not give any details about the specific incidents. It only gives the information of how many died and where it was, but does not say who the shooter was, or the situation revolving it. This is a limitation because you do not get to know any more information about the “why” or “how” of the situation. Regarding gun laws, the person could have had the weapon for a while and did not just purchase it, which would defeat the gun law issue raised in the story.</p>
			
			<h3>The incidents of mass shootings also increased with the fatalities with a massive 138.28% increase in the shooting incidents from 2013 to 2020. The numbers jumped from 256 incidents to 610 incidents.</h3>

			<p>“The FBI does not have a definition for mass shooting, they have a definition for mass murder. There definition is four or more killed not including the perpetrator, their mass murder definition includes shootings, poising’s, stabbings, bombings…it is to trigger a set of processes…When we started in 2013 there was no definition for mass shooting so we looked at mass murder definition…and we said we want to focus on those that are injured and adding that to it to make mass shooting, it is a super set of mass murder” says Bryant.</p>

			<h3>The states with the softest gun laws seem to be the ones with the most shootings.</h3>
			
			<p>“The red states that have fewer laws, they are growing fast as far as numbers of shootings are concerned” says Bryant. California is one of the states with the hardest gun laws and is a blue state. They regulate all of the sale, distribution, and use of firearms and ammunition. They have the highest deaths, however their rate is almost 9 people out of 100,000 people were killed. A state like Florida, which is known as a red state, where they are not very restrictive when it comes to gun laws, has a rate of nearly 12 people out of 100,000 being killed. This supports the claim of red states having less laws and that leads to more deaths. Another state like Florida is Missouri, where their laws are very loose and people do not even need a permit to purchase a handgun, and their rate was a little over 19 people out of 100,000 being killed. Although it looks as if California is the worst, this shows that the claim about red states seems to be accurate according to this data. </p>

			<h3>It is time for change.</h3>
			
			<p>Something needs to be done about these devastating incidents, and this data shows that if there are better laws in place, then the deaths are lower. There seems to be a correlation between this and if all the states came to an agreement about gun laws and made them more restricted, there is a chance this issue can become a thing of the past. Bryant says “if it all possible I’d like to see my job go away.” If the leaders of our country can come together and look at the statistics of what needs to be done, then Bryant's wish could come true.</p>
